Algorithms
----------

Classical algorithms in Java.

"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."
Albert Einstein

Basic data structures
---------------------

Lists
Queues
Stacks

Hashes

Trees


Analisys of algorithms
----------------------

- how long will it take to run?
- how much memory will it need?

Big O notation
--------------
constant = 1

logarithm = log N

linear = N

linearithmic = N log N

quadratic = N^2

cubic = N^3

exponential = 2^N


Dynamic connectivity
--------------------
The relation "is connected to" is an equivalence relation and has these properties:

* reflexive: p is connected to p
* symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p
* transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r.
